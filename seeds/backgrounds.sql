  'Shelter of the Faithful', 'As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle. You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.',

The gods try to speak to us, we just need to listen.","Nothing can shake my optimistic attitude.","I quote (or misquote) sacred texts and proverbs in almost every situation.","I am tolerant (or intolerant) of other faiths and respect (or condemn) the worship of other gods.","I''ve enjoyed fine food, drink, and high society among my temple''s elite.

We must help bring about the changes the gods are constantly working in the world.","Power. I hope to one day rise to the top of my faith''s religious hierarchy.","Faith. I trust that my deity will guide my actions. I have faith that if I work hard, things will go well.","Aspiration. I seek to prove myself worthy of my god''s favor by matching my actions against his or her teachings."]',

  '["I judge others harshly, and myself even more severely.","I put too much trust in those who wield power within my temple''s hierarchy.","My piety sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess faith in my god.","I am inflexible in my thinking.","I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them.","Once I pick a goal, I become obsessed with it to the detriment of everything else in my life."]', 'srd'
